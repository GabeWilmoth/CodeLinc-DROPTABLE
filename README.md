### Project: 
* **Challenge:**
  Come up with a unique solution to the problems faced by veterans whether they are freshly removed from service or already in civilian life. Many issues can arise such as being able to translate skills from service into the everyday job market, thus presenting a multitude of other challenges.

* **Solution:**
  "Veteran Job Finder" a webApp backed by springboot, dialogFlow, bootstrap, Apache POI, and several other core components. This application presents the user with an intuitive UI and asks a series of basic questions in order to find relative jobs and relative fields. Built on top of the previously mentioned functionality we also present a ChatBot system via dialogFlow allowing for the user to communicate with what feels like a person and help push a more user-friendly system overall. A final feature built on top of the job finder is a recommended resume screen in which the user can fill out basic information and generate a .doc file with a template and said information in it, providing yet again a positive user experience.
